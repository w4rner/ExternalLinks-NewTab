# ExternalLinks-NewTab
 Two codeblocks to inject into HTML to make all external links on your website open in new tab. Can potentially help reduce bounce rate from your website.
## Where to inject 
Each file name states where to inject each <script> tag into your HTML code.
 
## Example
See CrystalCUBED.com for an example of this being used in the context of a website builder, and w4rner.com for a website coded from scratch.
